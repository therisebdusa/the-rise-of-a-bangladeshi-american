# The Rise Of A Bangladeshi American
### Back up of of "The Rise"

"The Rise" series is my autobiography. A better place to read this series is on [Medium](https://therisebdusa.medium.com/).

I have provided this GitHub repo with a nearly up to date version of all the posts on Medium for personal usage only. I am not sure if I will keep "The Rise" series on Medium or GitHub indefinitely.

This repo is available for individuals  that would be upset to find "The Rise" series no longer online for a future reading or perhaps, to share with a friend. In that case, feel free to download this repo as a .zip or fork.

The reason I'm not sure if I want to keep this series online, is its highly sensitive and personal nature. But at the same time, I feel once I published the series, it belongs to the world, not me only.

Sincerely,
Shohid

#### My DM in the female chat:

Along with the 2 photos a I mentioned some weeks ago, I've included this photo about Matriarchy and Estrangement. 

My objective isn't to blame anyone but to acknowledge a growing rift that has spawned in the family. 

As someone who is close with some of the younger male cousins and recently been getting more comfortable with the females in this group and encouraging the male cousins to do the same and hearing some of your perspectives, I think this is an issue that must be acknowledged before a solution can be made. 

Not that you need to agree with how I'm framing the problem. 

I've heard from some of you, how the boys hurt the girls. 

I think that POV is equally valid. 

This is my interpretion of the problem from my limited POV.

My objective isn't to blame anyone but to acknowledge a growing rift that has spawned in the family. 

As someone who is close with some of the younger males and recently been getting more comfortable with the females in this group and encouraging the males to do the same and hearing some of your perspectives in the past, I think this is an issue that must be brought to our awareness before things can improve.

Not that you need to agree with how I'm framing the problem. I've heard from some of you, how the boys hurt the girls. I think that POV is equally valid. 

This is my interpretion of the problem from my limited POV that some of you may not be consciously aware of, but at least I've observed you might be aware of this emotionally. As in feeling excluded or distanced by the guys, requesting that I get X to engage with you more. This is a generalization, and may not apply to each person in this chat, but I think all of us in the family should be aware of this issue.

If you find in my series my points on Matriarchy, especially offensive, all I can say is I wasn't sure if I should have included female family in on the loop in my bio series. So it's not my intention to inflict harm, but I can understand if hearing what I say is hurtful.

I hope you take it as an opportunity to eavesdrop on some of my views that I normally would not share with you.

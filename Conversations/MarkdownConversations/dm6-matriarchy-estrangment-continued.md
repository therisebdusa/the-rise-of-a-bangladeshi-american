### In The Family

#### Gals
"I didn't know I was actively being distanced. I thought boys just stop talking to girls as they grow up."

That's what light estrangement is, minimizing emotional/social/physical contact and a pretense relationship of saying hello to prevent the other person from thinking anything is up.

Hard estrangement is going no contact and is far less common.

#### Guys
"I really appreciate what you shared about the matriarchy.  I don't know if it's true of all Islamic Culture or just Bengalis, cuz alot of our uncles are soft and bend over to their wives...I know how to be a chameleon and blend in with the females if I have to."

"I'm not marrying a Bengali wife, that's for sure."

#### Myself
In my case, I don't want marriage or kids. When you order me to do so, I play along out of prudence. It's an inauthentic interaction.

It'd be priceless if the family can evaluate what relationships they have, that they hold to be true, but in reality are a pretense. So that our family can move towards genuine and sincere relationships.

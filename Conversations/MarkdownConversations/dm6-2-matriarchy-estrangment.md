Wait, Matriarchy exists in Islamic culture? Yes. Alot of the guys just want to work their job, come home, eat, go to sleep and repeat. Secure a home for themselves and see their kids off to college. To avoid dealing with drama, they bend over to their wive's desires.  The elder meetings with the guys are often proxy meetings as the guys just push for what their wive's want.

So, Patriarchy isn't a thing in Islamic culture? Not true. Those girls weren't able to secure an education, learn to drive or get a car, establish a career for themselves. The only way to get what they want is to request from the people who have resources. They've learned to create drama: verbal abuse, gaslighting, destruction of property, manipulation, deception, gossip. Whatever they have to. Those girls are backed into a corner of servititude and are vying for their freedom in the only way possible in this unhealthy format.

It's sad that some of the girls who grew up with the freedoms that the US provides, conduct themselves in similar toxic manners to their elders. However, I can't hate, it's what they were taught in terms of social conduct. The boys are the same.

There are those that cling to this family. And uphold and perpetuate the toxic behavior of our elders. For example, by coercing others, especially their youngers, to do the same.

There are those that observed the toxicity of this family and outgrew those mindsets, but also withdraw themselves.

Is there a third option where our family can grow into a legitimately healthy and supportive community?

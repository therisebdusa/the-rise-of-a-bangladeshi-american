Our family has dissolved due to a few large turning points that were really just the tipping points from a constant and continuous state of toxicity.

People felt when we mourned the passing of our grandmother, the family was able to come together and perhaps a positive change will ensue. However, they were deeply upset, when as time passed, they felt others forgot to appreciate our family after our grandma's death and things reverted back to the status quo.

I wasn't so infatuated during our grandma's funeral. A similar thing happened when my father passed.  Though I wasn't infatuated then either. I played along with the funeral processation, as avoiding the family at that point would have created alot of drama for myself and hurt alot of people's feelings, during a moment of their greiving. I'm not so cold blooded.

However, when the dust settled, the family reegaged in its habitual behaviors, which is to be expected. Things won't change unless we acknowledge the underlying condition of our family and outgrow the toxic elements in our community.

If we aren't able to do so, the family will continue to dissolve. In that case, I hope this bio can at least give a glimpse into some of the factors contributing to our dissolution. I know for me and some of the people I've talked to, being able to express and understand these concepts in words helps prevent serious emotional crisis and identity issues regarding the collapse of our family and relationships.

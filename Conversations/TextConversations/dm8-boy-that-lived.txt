"...

I'm not sure if I am superior to other people. Certain conditions have allowed me to work towards achieving my potential that others were obstructed from achieving. I think each generation does what we can to make it easier for the next generation to achieve their potential.

It's sad how many people aren't on a trajectory to achieving their potential. Sad for themselves and society at large. But I am optimistic each generation moves us closer to this, a utopia."

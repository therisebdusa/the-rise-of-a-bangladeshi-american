For those who want context about this series as it was unfolding, I highlighted a few comments I recieved in each part as a `.txt` file. Alternatively, take a look at `ScreenshotConversations` to view images of these conversations.

Note: Each comment I recieved did not necessarily come for that Part. Most of these comments were written/recieved in the very beginning of the autobiography launch. But I wanted to include a comment per post to give some added context.

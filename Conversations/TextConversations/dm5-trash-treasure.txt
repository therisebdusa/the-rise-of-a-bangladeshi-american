_______: 

I really like how you talked about that you shouldn't be entitled to things.

That's something I'm trying to implement myself

Shohid: 

Appreciate it _________

One thing that helped me let go of entitlement, is growing up in the US, I think we have the view that being raised in a nuclear home with a loving mom and dad is the expectation based on what you see on TV and shows.

But in reality, lots of kids: 

1 have parents that acted abusively in the past to them at one point or another, if not regularly. 

2 do not have 2 parents, but instead single moms. 

3 then experienced step parents / step siblings. 

4 have no real parent, and instead were raised by their eldest or elder siblings.

5 are in the foster care system, which means the government is your caretakers. 

Of the lucky, they were adopted, but most adopted families are not "normal." Eg have 2 dads or 2 moms as bisexual partners often go for adoption. And talk about racial identity, kids in this group aren't often paired with people of the same cultural / racial backround. Eg if you were in the foster care system but got adopted by ******

6 grow up in a communal family (me). Even if I didn't have a traditional mom, that's not less than someone who did. It's very normal, especially in countries with village type environments, to have a communal family.

In conclusion, you might feel entitled to a better mom or family dynamic but in reality, what you have is something someone else wishes for. It's easier to feel grateful for what you have when you put yourself in the shoes of someone that wants what you have.

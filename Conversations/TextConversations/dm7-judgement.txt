Goals for the family:

Even if my bio doesn't lead to our communal bengali family having a fairy tale ending, I'm hoping exposing how dysfunctional our relationships has been will help reduce feelings of frustrations towards individuals.

Such as, I often hear people complain about someone else, "Why would X do Y to Z???"

I often felt these feelings before but, that was largely because I couldn't wrap my mind around various abuses I witnessed or heard.  But once I was able to articulate how many individuals actions are closely tied to the larger context of our family, I can stay relaxed much more easily and be less judgemental.

Goals for myself:

I'm hoping that when I'm judged, at least I'll be judged more accurately. For example, instead of being judged for being a bad Muslim that doesn't pray, I'll be judged for not being a Muslim.

Even positive judgement I'd like to better reflect reality. When people in the family say they are proud of how I take care of my mom, it never touched my heart in the past.

Or when people are proud of my accomplishments in sports, mentioning how hard and rare it is to see a strong Bengali athlete, but don't consider how much they peronally obstructed my pursuits in life.

I feel like I've given myself the freedom to leave this family and my mom behind, move far away and block everyone, if that's what I must do to live my best life. At least if I'm judged, I'll be judged more accurately. And this experience has granted me much thicker skin.

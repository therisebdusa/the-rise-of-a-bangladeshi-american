"It was a good read. I only have a small sense of what you went through and I can understand it was much more than what was said here. The post gave a glimpse of the difficulties of your childhood with your parents. I would also like to know about other parts of your life as well, your passion, hobbies, friends, and what you did for fun, etc.
You've talked about having fond memories of your childhood, and there were no description of any fond memories mentioned in the post.
In addition to what I read, I would also like to know about few good memories or experiences of your childhood with your parents, siblings, family members, or friends.
So, please try to add some good memories as well in each posts that you make in the future."

"Thanks so much for your comment a_tribal_member
As to including happy memories, hobbies and other aspects along those lines. It won’t be for some time as the next posts will only be regarding “The Rise” series which don’t really go into those kind of things.
“The Rise” series is basically done. It’s auto scheduled until all 8 parts are up. It’s been reviewed by me at least 20 times over the last 4 months and reviewed by multiple reviewers. The only edits I really do is looking at the posts once before their released for small tweaks. But as a different post exploring my hobbies, that’d be cool, so thanks for the suggestion.
One reason I decided to release the “The Rise” as an 8 part weekly release, rather than say a book, is to provide an opportunity to make this experience more interactive. To talk to people online, friends / family as it’s unfolding. So do keep reading and I’d love to hear more of your POV in the future posts if you decide to share a comment again in the future!
But, I also get the impression you felt this story is so negative and want me to view my life more positively and remember and/or focus on other aspects of my life. I just want to assure you that if you met me in person, you’d likely think I’m an extremely positive person, and I do share those happy memories and passions with people irl. This blog was an opportunity for me to share an aspect of myself that I have kept under wraps as I didn’t know how to express it in a healthy manner to my friends and family and even to the whole world."

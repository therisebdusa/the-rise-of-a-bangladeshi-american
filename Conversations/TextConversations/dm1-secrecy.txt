Featured comment from Part 1.

"...just got around to reading the first part of your blog series, it was really well thought out. I could relate to a lot of it growing up watching my dad hit my mom and having to break up fights between them. He's addicted to betel too with anger issues. He has diabetes and works all day with no regard to his mental or physical health. I wish our community could be vocal about these deep rooted issues and with your series it's definitely helping remove the veil of secrecy behind this topic. Keep doing what you're doing..."

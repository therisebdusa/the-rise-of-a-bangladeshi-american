In the family.

Some gals: "I didn't know I was actively being distanced. I thought boys just stop talking to girls as they grow up."

That's what light estrangement is, minimizing emotional/social/physical contact and a pretense relationship of saying hello to prevent the other person from thinking anything is up.

Hard estrangement is going no contact and is far less common.

A guy: "I really appreciate what you shared about the matriarchy.  I don't know if it's true of all Islamic Culture or just Bengalis, cuz alot of our uncles are soft and bend over to their wives...I know how to be a chameleon and blend in with the females if I have to."

Some guys: "I'm not marrying a Bengali wife, that's for sure."

In my case, I don't want marriage or kids. When you order me to do so, I play along out of prudence. It's an inauthentic interaction.

It'd be priceless if the family can evaluate what relationships they have, that they hold to be true, but in reality are a pretense. So that our family can move towards genuine and sincere relationships.

----------------------
Wait, Matriarchy exists in Islamic culture? Yes. Alot of the guys just want to work their job, come home, eat, go to sleep and repeat. Secure a home for themselves and see their kids off to college. To avoid dealing with drama, they bend over to their wive's desires.  The elder meetings with the guys are often proxy meetings as the guys just push for what their wive's want.

So, Patriarchy isn't a thing in Islamic culture? Not true. Those girls weren't able to secure an education, learn to drive or get a car, establish a career for themselves. The only way to get what they want is to request from the people who have resources. They've learned to create drama: verbal abuse, gaslighting, destruction of property, manipulation, deception, gossip. Whatever they have to. Those girls are backed into a corner of servititude and are vying for their freedom in the only way possible in this unhealthy format.

It's sad that some of the girls who grew up with the freedoms that the US provides, conduct themselves in similar toxic manners to their elders. However, I can't hate, it's what they were taught in terms of social conduct. The boys are the same.

There are those that cling to this family. And uphold and perpetuate the toxic behavior of our elders. For example, by coercing others, especially their youngers, to do the same.

There are those that observed the toxicity of this family and outgrew those mindsets, but also withdraw themselves.

Is there a third option where our family can grow into a legitimately healthy and supportive community?

------------------
Our family has dissolved due to a few large turning points that were really just the tipping points from a constant and continuous state of toxicity.

People felt when we mourned the passing of our grandmother, the family was able to come together and perhaps a positive change will ensue. However, they were deeply upset, when as time passed, they felt others forgot to appreciate our family after our grandma's death and things reverted back to the status quo.

I wasn't so infatuated during our grandma's funeral. A similar thing happened when my father passed.  Though I wasn't infatuated then either. I played along with the funeral processation, as avoiding the family at that point would have created alot of drama for myself and hurt alot of people's feelings, during a moment of their greiving. I'm not so cold blooded.

However, when the dust settled, the family reegaged in its habitual behaviors, which is to be expected. Things won't change unless we acknowledge the underlying condition of our family and outgrow the toxic elements in our community.

If we aren't able to do so, the family will continue to dissolve. In that case, I hope this bio can at least give a glimpse into some of the factors contributing to our dissolution. I know for me and some of the people I've talked to, being able to express and understand these concepts in words helps prevent serious emotional crisis and identity issues regarding the collapse of our family and relationships.

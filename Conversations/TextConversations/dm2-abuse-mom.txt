"...im truly curious to learn more about how you physically abused your mom. idk if its something your comfortable talking about..."

"...Thanks for all the feedback ... I wouldn't recommend viewing taking sides as human nature. I'd recommend to view it as something you can work on.

I used to punch my mom in the arm when I was mad at her and felt she deserved it. I stopped once when I went to far and caused her to have a manic episode and felt bad. That she doesn't deserve this regardless of if she does harmful things to me. I do not believe in revenge.

If you judge me, that's fine. But one thing I want to illuminate in this series is: "It's easy to look at someone who made poor decisions in life with contempt."

Blame/judgment accomplishes nothing. It's better to ask: "How can we help these people live healthier?"

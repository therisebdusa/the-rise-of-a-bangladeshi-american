Featured comment from Part 3.

Thoughts:

Matriarchy. I have feelings of lingering abuse at the hands of my female elders. I've quietly kept my distance. Even from the younger females who do not harm me directly, but have leaked information upstream. My younger male cousins have complained to me about mistreatment by my younger female family that treated them like my elder females have treated me.

Estrangement. This has lead and will continue to lead to males dropping out of this family emotionally and physically, to the pain of our females. 

Reality. This situation is mutually harmful for everyone.

"As for ... that's up to you. In the Bengali ...  majority of them have the mentality of an uncle and some aunts. I would be cautious."

Thoughts: I have traditionally only been intimate with my younger male cousins and nephews. I decided to send the bio out to a portion of the family I have kept a distance towards.

In the female group chat:

"Hi Shohid, thank you for sharing this. I am looking forward to reading about your experiences and struggles growing up as a Bengali American, and how it shaped you and the relationships around you.

I know it's not easy to put out your feelings and experiences into words. So, I appreciate the courage you took to put yourself out there.

Keep it up! Looking forward to it."

My dm in the female group chat:

"Along with the 2 photos I mentioned a week ago, I've included this photo about Matriarchy and Estrangement that I'll include in the post.

My objective isn't to blame anyone but to acknowledge a growing rift that has spawned in the family. 

As someone who is close with some of the younger males and recently been getting more comfortable with the females in this group and encouraging the males to do the same and hearing some of your perspectives in the past, I think this is an issue that must be brought to our awareness before things can improve.

Not that you need to agree with how I'm framing the problem. I've heard from some of you, how the boys hurt the girls. I think that POV is equally valid. 

This is my interpretion of the problem from my limited POV that some of you may not be consciously aware of, but at least I've observed you might be aware of this emotionally. As in feeling excluded or distanced by the guys, requesting that I get X to engage with you more. This is a generalization, and may not apply to each person in this chat, but I think all of us in the family should be aware of this issue.

If you find in my series my points on Matriarchy, especially offensive, all I can say is I wasn't sure if I should have included female family in on the loop in my bio series. So it's not my intention to inflict harm, but I can understand if hearing what I say is hurtful.

I hope you take it as an opportunity to eavesdrop on some of my views that I normally would not share with you."

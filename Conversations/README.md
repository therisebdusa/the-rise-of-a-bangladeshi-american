The folder was included to keep this Github repo "complete." That is, if the blog ever goes down on Medium, all of the comments are not lost.

For those who want context about this series as it was unfolding, I highlighted a few comments I recieved in each part. Take a look at `ScreenshotConversations` to view images of these conversations or `TextConversations` to read `.txt` versions.

`MarkdownConversations` were simply used to reformat some of the `TextConversations` into Screenshots.

Note: Each comment I recieved did not necessarily come for that Part. Most of these comments were written/recieved in the very beginning of the autobiography launch. But I wanted to include a comment per post to give some added context.
